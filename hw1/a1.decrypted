You are reading the plaintext of the second assignment in our cryptography course.
For this assignment first implement your own RSA cryptosystem which works for text 
files in the same manner that this assignment was encrypted.
Second reencrypt this plaintext with your own RSA keys and then submit the
encrypted text file via email along with the RSA secret keys which are the
RSA modulus and RSA secret decryption exponent used. You may implement RSA
in any programming language of your choice. Submit the source for your RSA
program in a separate compressed file by email. This assignment is due in a
month from today.
